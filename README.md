# Unit Gateway H2

## Overview

### SKU:U195

Unit Gateway H2 is a new form of gateway unit, built on the ESP32-H2-MINI-1 chip, featuring a RISC-V architecture 32-bit single-core MCU, integrated IEEE 802.15.4 wireless communication capabilities, and support for ZigBee, Thread, and the Matter interconnect protocol based on Thread. Additionally, it comes equipped with a hardware encryption engine to meet the needs of high-security IoT applications. This product communicates with M5 series hosts via the Grove (Port C) interface using serial (UART) communication for data exchange. Unit Gateway H2 can flexibly act as either a gateway or an end device, working in tandem with the host to build cross-ecosystem connectivity or independently running IoT applications. Furthermore, it features a standard program download interface and a Type-C interface for firmware flashing and debugging of the H2 chip. An onboard button provides convenient physical interaction, allowing for device reset or triggering other custom operations. This product is suitable for various scenarios such as smart homes, environmental monitoring, sensor networks, and low-power wireless communication nodes.
